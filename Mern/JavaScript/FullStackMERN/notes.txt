Navigate to server folder and create server.js file (touch server.js)
Create a package.json (refered to as "new project" on platform?) (npm init -y)
Install express (npm install express)

Add the following code to the server.js file:

    const express = require('express');
    const cors = require('cors')
    const app = express();
    const port = 8000;

    app.use(cors())

    require('./routes/person.routes')(app); 

    app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port: ${port}`) );
